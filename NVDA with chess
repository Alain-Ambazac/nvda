Hello,
I can not use this web page with NVDA.
http://www.diagonaletv.com/applets/live-malvoyants.html
There seems to be a conflict with the arrows keys of this web application and NVDA.
Can you please tell me what you think about that and if thre can be a solution.
The best is to try whith someone who can see and explain how this chess web application works.
Thanks.
Alain
